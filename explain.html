    <h1>* What´s communication design?</h1>
    <div class="quote wikipedia">
      <p>"Communication design is a mixed discipline between design and
        information-development which is concerned with how media intervention
         such as printed, crafted, electronic media or presentations communicate
          with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with
           developing the message aside from the aesthetics in media, but also with
            creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience.
            Some designers use graphic design and communication design interchangeably
            due to overlapping skills." - wikipedia.com
